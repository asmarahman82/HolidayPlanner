# HolidayPlanner — A Multi-Agent AI System for Automated Travel Itinerary Planning

**Short description:**  
HolidayPlanner is a multi-agent, LLM-enhanced travel planning system that produces personalized itineraries by combining live data (weather, venue listings) with AI reasoning. The project demonstrates LangGraph-based orchestration of specialized agents (input, destination, weather, budget, itinerary, result, metrics) and integrates external services including OpenWeather, Yelp, Hugging Face, and Groq.


## Project Overview
HolidayPlanner accepts user-provided destination, budget, duration and preferences, then orchestrates a team of agents to fetch real-time weather and local places, estimate budget feasibility, and generate a day-by-day itinerary with human-readable summaries. The project is designed for reproducibility and modular extension.


## Key Features
- Multi-agent orchestration using **LangGraph**
- Live weather integration (OpenWeather)
- Local places and ratings (Yelp)
- LLM-based itinerary generation (Hugging Face / Groq)
- Clear modular architecture for extensibility and testing
- CLI execution for Module 2 reproducibility; streamlit UI planned in Module 3
- Logging and basic metrics capture for observability


## Quick Demo (CLI)
```bash
python main.py
# Follow the prompts:
# Enter destination: Jeddah
# Enter budget (USD): 1500
# Enter preferences (comma-separated): beaches,culture
